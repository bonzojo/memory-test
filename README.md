# A deliberately annoying memory test
---

A hasbro simon game inspired memory test, substituting colors with pictures of animals and audible feedback. 

Press Start and the cpu will initiate building a sequence each level. Upon the player correctly inputting the same sequence, the player will accumulate a score and progress each level. 

Audio files are short and snappy as longer audio files were clashing, distorting and creating a cacophany akin to a distressed zoo.
