# Memory-Test
## A Simon game / memory test

A simon game style memory test substituting colours with pictures of animals.
The computer sequence is initiated upon starting the game and then following a successful human input will continue to iterate upon the sequence and update the score.
The animal pictures and audio give it a little more charm than just flat colours.
I chose short audio files as when initially developing it, longer audio files would clash, distort and create a cacophany akin to a distressed zoo.
